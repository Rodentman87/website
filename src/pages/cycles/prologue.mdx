<IntroQuote>The universe is a wild and beautiful place.</IntroQuote>

I figured that with everything I’ve seen I should start to document my travels. While this may not be a replacement for seeing the Cycles yourself, documenting them for people who aren't as lucky as I am to have a job where I get to travel this often is a decent alternative. It also seems like a nice way to make this journal useful since my boss spent his own money on it. Let me give you a little background first, just to catch you up to speed.

Growing up, my parents never really made a big deal out of each Cycle on our planet, but I just couldn’t get enough of all the festivities. Seeing people dressed in vibrant colors from head to toe. Every Cycle, the wolves would shed their old fur, which by then had grown long and gray, to reveal a fresh coat. With each iteration, the fur would change colors. All the kids in the town would try to guess which color they were going to be, and the winners would get candy. When I was in school, I would learn about the wolves at every chance I could. My teacher noticed my interest pretty quickly. “The universe is a wild and beautiful place,” she would always say. She would search for any books about the Cycles that she could find and ask our library to get a copy for me. I found it so fascinating that every planet has a naturally occurring marker of the new year.

Once I was old enough to have my own computer, it opened the universe to me. People would share the most amazing pictures and videos of their planet’s Cycle. This brings us to today, as part of my work I now get to travel the universe. I haven’t seen much yet, but it is certainly a sight to behold. It’s been almost a year since I started what’s going to hopefully be a long career, and my boss got me this journal as a birthday present.

A picture may be worth a thousand words, but some things are best if you let your imagination run a little wild. I’m not quite sure what I’m going to do with this when I’m done. Sharing it online seems like a great way to get others as interested in the Cycles as I am, but I may get a little personal in here and I’m not sure the world would like to see that. We’ll see how it goes, and I guess if you’re reading this then it means I’ve shared at least some of this.
